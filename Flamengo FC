Flamengo FC Professional Team Database 

Business Description:  
Flamengo FC, officially known as Clube de Regatas do Flamengo, is one of Brazil’s most popular and successful football clubs, based in Rio de Janeiro. The organization manages hundreds of players across different age categories, multiple competitions per season, and a massive base of fans and staff members. 
This database is designed to support the club’s internal operations, focusing on player management, match scheduling, and performance tracking. It will help staff easily store, retrieve, and analyze essential information such as player statistics, match outcomes, training sessions, and team performance indicators. 

User’s Perspective: 
From a user’s perspective, this system can be used by coaches, analysts, and administrative staff. Coaches can view players’ stats, track goals or assists per match, and monitor fitness updates. Analysts can generate performance reports per player or per match to identify trends and make data-driven decisions. Administrative staff can register players, schedule upcoming matches, and maintain match histories — all from a single relational database. 
The system ensures data accuracy, quick access to information, and easy reporting — reducing the amount of manual work currently done in spreadsheets or paper records.

Overall Database Design: 
The Flamengo FC Professional Team database was designed to efficiently store and organize information related to players, staff members, matches, and performance statistics. The goal was to create a relational structure that mirrors how a real professional soccer club manages its operational data while maintaining simplicity and full normalization. The core of the design focuses on two main entities — Player and MatchInfo — and a Performance table that records the many-to-many relationship between them, since players participate in multiple matches and each match includes multiple players. This separation ensures that performance statistics are not duplicated and can be analyzed cleanly. 
During the normalization process, all tables were brought to Third Normal Form (3NF). This required separating staff information into its own table and creating a junction table, MatchStaff, to represent the many-to-many relationship between matches and staff members. Without a linking table, staff involvement in matches would either be partially represented or create unnecessary duplication. By isolating attributes into their appropriate tables and ensuring that each non-key attribute depends solely on its table's primary key, the database avoids update, insertion, and deletion anomalies. 
Another key design decision was ensuring flexibility. This database could easily expand to include additional Flamengo squads (U20, U17), training sessions, contracts, or injury tracking without major restructuring. The design also includes indexes on frequently queried fields (such as player positions and staff roles), improving query performance. Overall, the model balances clarity, normalization, and real-world usability while supporting complex SQL queries required by the project.

Player Table 
The Player table stores the essential biographical and professional information for each Flamengo professional player, including name, nationality, position, and shirt number. It serves as the foundation for tracking individual player participation in matches. All player-specific statistics are recorded separately in the Performance table. 

MatchInfo Table 
The MatchInfo table records all official games Flamengo plays, including the opponent, competition, stadium, date, and final score. It functions as the central reference point for connecting performance data and staff participation. Each match can involve multiple players and multiple staff members. 

Performance Table 
The Performance table represents the many-to-many relationship between players and matches, storing detailed in-game statistics such as goals, assists, minutes played, and match rating. This structure allows for robust statistical analysis of individual player performance across different competitions. Each record refers uniquely to a player-match combination. 

Staff Table 
The Staff table stores information about coaches, assistants, medical personnel, and analysts who work directly with the Flamengo professional squad. It keeps track of their names, roles, and contact information. Since staff may participate in multiple matches, their match involvement is tracked separately. 

MatchStaff Table 
The MatchStaff table connects staff members to the matches they participated in, serving as a junction table to model their many-to-many relationship with matches. It also records the specific role the staff member served in that match (e.g., Head Coach, Physio). This enables detailed analysis of match preparation and staffing patterns.
