###Flamengo FC Professional Team Database 

Business Description:  
Flamengo FC, officially known as Clube de Regatas do Flamengo, is one of Brazil’s most popular and successful football clubs, based in Rio de Janeiro. The organization manages hundreds of players across different age categories, multiple competitions per season, and a massive base of fans and staff members. 
This database is designed to support the club’s internal operations, focusing on player management, match scheduling, and performance tracking. It will help staff easily store, retrieve, and analyze essential information such as player statistics, match outcomes, training sessions, and team performance indicators. 

User’s Perspective: 
From a user’s perspective, this system can be used by coaches, analysts, and administrative staff. Coaches can view players’ stats, track goals or assists per match, and monitor fitness updates. Analysts can generate performance reports per player or per match to identify trends and make data-driven decisions. Administrative staff can register players, schedule upcoming matches, and maintain match histories — all from a single relational database. 
The system ensures data accuracy, quick access to information, and easy reporting — reducing the amount of manual work currently done in spreadsheets or paper records.

Overall Database Design: 
The Flamengo FC Professional Team database was designed to efficiently store and organize information related to players, staff members, matches, and performance statistics. The goal was to create a relational structure that mirrors how a real professional soccer club manages its operational data while maintaining simplicity and full normalization. The core of the design focuses on two main entities — Player and MatchInfo — and a Performance table that records the many-to-many relationship between them, since players participate in multiple matches and each match includes multiple players. This separation ensures that performance statistics are not duplicated and can be analyzed cleanly. 
During the normalization process, all tables were brought to Third Normal Form (3NF). This required separating staff information into its own table and creating a junction table, MatchStaff, to represent the many-to-many relationship between matches and staff members. Without a linking table, staff involvement in matches would either be partially represented or create unnecessary duplication. By isolating attributes into their appropriate tables and ensuring that each non-key attribute depends solely on its table's primary key, the database avoids update, insertion, and deletion anomalies. 
Another key design decision was ensuring flexibility. This database could easily expand to include additional Flamengo squads (U20, U17), training sessions, contracts, or injury tracking without major restructuring. The design also includes indexes on frequently queried fields (such as player positions and staff roles), improving query performance. Overall, the model balances clarity, normalization, and real-world usability while supporting complex SQL queries required by the project.

Player Table 
The Player table stores the essential biographical and professional information for each Flamengo professional player, including name, nationality, position, and shirt number. It serves as the foundation for tracking individual player participation in matches. All player-specific statistics are recorded separately in the Performance table. 

MatchInfo Table 
The MatchInfo table records all official games Flamengo plays, including the opponent, competition, stadium, date, and final score. It functions as the central reference point for connecting performance data and staff participation. Each match can involve multiple players and multiple staff members. 

Performance Table 
The Performance table represents the many-to-many relationship between players and matches, storing detailed in-game statistics such as goals, assists, minutes played, and match rating. This structure allows for robust statistical analysis of individual player performance across different competitions. Each record refers uniquely to a player-match combination. 

Staff Table 
The Staff table stores information about coaches, assistants, medical personnel, and analysts who work directly with the Flamengo professional squad. It keeps track of their names, roles, and contact information. Since staff may participate in multiple matches, their match involvement is tracked separately. 

MatchStaff Table 
The MatchStaff table connects staff members to the matches they participated in, serving as a junction table to model their many-to-many relationship with matches. It also records the specific role the staff member served in that match (e.g., Head Coach, Physio). This enables detailed analysis of match preparation and staffing patterns.

Queries

This query retrieves all players and orders them first by position and then by shirt_number. This type of sorting is useful when coaches want to see the roster organized by tactical roles and player jersey number order.
Query 1
SELECT player_id, full_name, position, shirt_number
FROM Player
ORDER BY position, shirt_number;

This query calculates a player’s goal contribution per match by adding goals and assists. It is used to evaluate a player’s direct involvement in scoring actions.
Query 2
SELECT P.full_name, F.goals, F.assists,
(F.goals + F.assists) AS total_contribution
FROM Performance F
JOIN Player P ON F.player_id = P.player_id;

This query extracts the month of each match using the MONTH() function. Useful to analyze match frequency or performance by month.
Query 3
SELECT 
    match_id,
    match_date,
    MONTH(match_date) AS match_month,
    opponent
FROM Match_Info
LIMIT 10;

This query calculates the total goals scored by each player and returns only players with 5 or more total goal contributions. This is helpful for identifying high-impact players.
Query 4
SELECT 
    P.full_name,
    SUM(F.goals) AS total_goals,
    SUM(F.assists) AS total_assists
FROM Performance F
JOIN Player P ON F.player_id = P.player_id
GROUP BY P.full_name
HAVING SUM(F.goals) + SUM(F.assists) >= 5;

This query combines Player, Performance, and Match_Info to show player stats for each match. This multi-table join is useful for match analysis systems.
Query 5
SELECT 
    P.full_name,
    M.opponent,
    F.goals,
    F.assists,
    F.minutes_played
FROM Performance F
JOIN Player P ON F.player_id = P.player_id
JOIN Match_Info M ON F.match_id = M.match_id
LIMIT 10;

This query lists all staff members and any match they participated in. Staff who did not work in a match will still appear because of the LEFT JOIN.
Query 6
SELECT 
    S.full_name,
    MS.match_id,
    MS.role_in_match
FROM Staff S
LEFT JOIN Match_staff MS ON S.staff_id = MS.staff_id
ORDER BY S.staff_id
LIMIT 20;

This query updates a player’s shirt number. This is used when a player changes jersey numbers during the season.
Query 7
UPDATE Player
SET shirt_number = 99
WHERE full_name = 'Pedro Guilherme';

This deletes a performance row where the player had 0 minutes played. Useful for cleaning data when substitutions never entered the match.
Query 8
DELETE FROM Performance
WHERE minutes_played = 90;

This view shows summary statistics for each player, including total goals and assists. Views allow reusable queries for dashboards or applications.
Query 9
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW Player_Stats AS
SELECT 
    P.player_id,
    P.full_name,
    SUM(F.goals) AS total_goals,
    SUM(F.assists) AS total_assists
FROM Player P
JOIN Performance F ON P.player_id = F.player_id
GROUP BY P.player_id;

-- Demonstrate using the view
SELECT * FROM Player_Stats LIMIT 10;

This query demonstrates a transaction: inserting a test player and then rolling back the change. Transactions protect the database from unwanted modifications.
Query 10
START TRANSACTION;

INSERT INTO Player (full_name, birth_date, nationality, position, shirt_number)
VALUES ('TEST PLAYER', '2000-01-01', 'Brazil', 'Forward', 99);

SELECT * FROM Player WHERE full_name = 'TEST PLAYER';

ROLLBACK;

SELECT * FROM Player WHERE full_name = 'TEST PLAYER';
